# Team 2: Project Description

Goal: Office Automation System for a Pediatric Doctor's Office

This Office Automation System streamlines administrative tasks and enhances patient record accessibility. Utilizing Java UI and JavaFX, the system facilitates nurse-led data entry of patient vitals and medical history, aiding doctors in diagnosis and treatment. Patients access their records via a web or mobile app, managing appointments, receiving prescriptions, and communicating securely with medical staff. Beyond health data, the system stores patient contact, insurance, and pharmacy details, optimizing overall office efficiency and patient care.
